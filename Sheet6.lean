# Logic in Lean, example sheet 6 : "or" (`∨`)

We learn about how to manipulate `P ∨ Q` in Lean.

## Tactics

You'll need to know about the tactics from the previous sheets,
and also the following tactics

* `left` and `right`
* `cases` (new functionality)

-- Throughout this sheet, `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S` will denote propositions.
variable (P Q R S : Prop)

example : P → P ∨ Q := by
  intro hP
  left
  exact hP

example : Q → P ∨ Q := by
  sorry

-- Here are a few ways to break down a disjunction
example : P ∨ Q → (P → R) → (Q → R) → R := by
  intro hPoQ
  cases hPoQ with
  | inl h => sorry
  | inr h => sorry

example : P ∨ Q → (P → R) → (Q → R) → R := by
  intro hPoQ
  obtain h | h := hPoQ
  · sorry
  · sorry

example : P ∨ Q → (P → R) → (Q → R) → R := by
  rintro (h | h)
  · sorry
  · sorry

-- symmetry of `or`
example : P ∨ Q → Q ∨ P := by
  sorry

-- associativity of `or`
example : (P ∨ Q) ∨ R ↔ P ∨ Q ∨ R := by
  sorry

example : (P → R) → (Q → S) → P ∨ Q → R ∨ S := by
  sorry

example : (P → Q) → P ∨ R → Q ∨ R := by
  sorry

example : (P ↔ R) → (Q ↔ S) → (P ∨ Q ↔ R ∨ S) := by
  sorry

-- de Morgan's laws
example : ¬(P ∨ Q) ↔ ¬P ∧ ¬Q := by
  sorry

example : ¬(P ∧ Q) ↔ ¬P ∨ ¬Q := by
  sorry
